## 4. Verdict

### Is this brute force activity? Yes
Pattern matches automated brute force: rapid failures, repeated user, high-value account.

## 5. Recommended Actions
Block or monitor IP 192.168.1.103

Check for corresponding successful login

Review logs for further attempts from similar IPs

Notify system owner of HOST2

Consider adding MFA to admin accounts

## 6. Lessons Learned

The alert effectively detected a suspicious burst of failed logins

Time-based threshold worked well

Next iteration: enrich alerts with username context (admin/root)
